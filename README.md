# HIGH LEVEL OUTLINE 

To build this game in Pygame, you will need to start by installing the Pygame library if you haven't already. You can do this by running "pip install pygame" in your command line.

1. Create the game's main loop: This will handle the game's updates, events and drawing to the screen.
2. Create the character and weapon select screens: These will allow the player to select their character and weapon before starting the game.
3. Create the dice rolling mechanics: You can use the random module in Python to generate random numbers for the dice rolls.
4. Create the hit and miss mechanics: Based on the dice roll, determine if the player's attack hits or misses and apply the appropriate effects.
5. Create the hit location mechanics: Roll another dice to determine the hit location and apply the appropriate effects.
6. Create the game's UI: You will need to display the player's health, the weapon they are using and other relevant information to the player.
7. Create the AI for the other players and their characters.
8. Test and debug your game, and make any necessary adjustments.
  

It is a big project, you might want to start small and build upon it as you go along. It's also a good idea to break the game down into smaller manageable chunks, and work on one piece at a time.
